It's a hardware based project 
Name:Arduino Mail Notifier

Description:
Physical Mail or Post is a method of transporting documents, packages, cards, parcels and letters. This service is usually done by a postal service system. Mail is usually delivered by mail man post man to our homes. We get important documents like bills, invitations, bank statements etc. in mail.

If we donâ€™t check our mail box regularly, we might miss the deadlines for payment of bills etc. It is a tedious job to regularly check for mail as mail boxes are often placed outside the house or in some cases, a common place at the end of the street.
Hence, in this project, a simple but efficient mail notifier system is designed using Arduino and few other components. This system notifies the user whenever there is a mail and hence avoiding the need to check for mail frequently.
The project is based on Arduino and a light sensor (Photo resistor or LDR).
